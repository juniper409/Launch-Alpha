This application is a work-in-progress. I'm using it to learn Python. Please feel free to use it. It is my goal to turn this into somewhat of a dashboard for space launches.

1. Download the following Python packages using pip:


```
pip install tweepy
```

2. Go to developer.twitter.com and sign up for developer tokens. Add the tokens to the "access_temp.py" file and rename it to "access.py".
